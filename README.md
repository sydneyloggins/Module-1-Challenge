# <Module-1-Challenge>

## Semantic HTML & Accessibility

The first challenge is intended to practice semantic HTML to organize code and make it accessible for users. The motivation behind this project is to learn the benefits of organizing HTML and creating accessible websites for universal use. Building this project created a better understanding of HTML and importance of providing accessibility to all users. I added alternative text to images and created a logical structure of positioning and style, and learned the importance of semantic HTML on a smaller scale to better understand how websites are organized.
